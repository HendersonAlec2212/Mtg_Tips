Tips and Guidelines for Slapping with Samurai
======================
 
> Note about exceptions to rules:
 
Every rule has cards that can stop it from happening normally. In MTG cards that say “don’t” do something always overpower cards that say “do” something.
 
    EX: A card says everyone draws 3 extra cards instead of one at the draw step, however another card says players Do Not draw extra cards. This means players do not draw extra cards.
 
So when you see a rule, just know that it stands until otherwise changed by a card.

# General MTG Rules:
## These rules set up the foundation for the game.
 
There will be 5 phases:
- Beginning Phase
- Main Phase 1
- Combat
- Main Phase 2
- End Step
 
Players will start with the same life ( exception Archenemy Format).
 
Your first hand must have 7 cards unless you mulligan.
 
`Mulligan = You draw a new hand at the start of the game if you dont like your first hand but draw one less card each time.`
 
# Spells:
In MTG, you cast spells in order to change the rules of the game and follow the existing and new rules in order to win.
 
I'll cover what types of spells you can play and when they can be played.
Creature, Artifact, Enchantment: can be played during Main Phase 1 & 2
Sorcery: can be played during Main Phase 1 & 2
Instant: Can be played at any time but requires understanding the stack to get full value out of them.
 
The majority of spells are played in the Main Phases 1 & 2, also called the Pre-Combat or Post-Combat Main Phase.
 
You can play the same spells during each of these Main Phases, the only difference is that one takes place after combat. Some cards have special abilities that will activate if they are played after a combat, or after damage has been dealt in combat.
 
 
## The Stack:
This is where spells happen. Imagine a stack of papers with orders on them. As players play spells they 'stack' on top of one another and are resolved/happen in the reverse order of | Newest -> Oldest |. The game will read the orders in the order of the stack, and the spells will happen in that order.
Ex: player A casts a creature spell, Player B counters that spell, Player A counters the other players counterspell.
 
    STACK:
    - Player A counter - This will take place 1st, removing Player B counter spell
    - Player B counter - Since this spell will be countered, it will not resolve and cannot target the creature
    - Player A creature - This spell is now safe and will enter the battlefield as a creature.
 
 
## Turn Phases:
These phases happen to every person, every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase.
 
Since your deck focuses on Combat, I'll be detailing combat steps for you to learn from.
 
# Beginning Phase (consists of 4 parts):
 
- Untap -
Untap all of your cards
 
- Upkeep -
Some cards have activations/triggers that happen here. Most of the time this step passes like the wind
 
- Draw -
Draw 1 card
 
- Pre-combat Main Phase / Main Phase 1 -
This is where the majority of stuff happens. This is where you can cast creature spells, play sorceries, enchants, artifacts, planeswalkers and instants.
 
------------------
 
# Combat:
Unlike in Yu-Gi-Oh, you do not target creatures during combat, you target players directly, every time.
 
Combat is Player vs Player(s)/Planeswalker(s) in MTG.
 
` A planeswalker is an entity with special abilities who can be targeted in combat just as a player can. These entities are summoned by players and have loyalty to whomever they were summoned by. `
 
Imagine you're an army general and you want to attack an enemy fortification ( the defending player ). You designate who will attack, the enemy decides if they will try to resist the attack and block one or more of your creatures, taking any leftover damage from unblocked creatures.
 
Creatures have a Power(atk) & Toughness(def) detailed in the following manner -> power/toughness
 
#### ---------------------------- Combat Breakdown ----------------------------
 
> Beginning of Combat Step
 
The first part of combat, this is a passive phase. Sometimes stuff happens here but not often.
 
If so, the ability will state "At the beginning of your/player combat, this happens..."
 
> Declare Attackers Step
 
This is where the fun starts. This is the time in which you decide who will be throwing punches on your side by tapping them. ( exception - Ability: Vigilance )
 
> Declare Blockers Step
 
In this step, the defending player chooses which creatures will block which attackers.
 
They can choose many to block one and if they do, the ATTACKER decides how much damage will be dealt to each blocker. Otherwise if One attacker is blocked by One Defender, All of attacking creatures damage is assigned to the defender. ( exception - Ability: Trample)
 
Blocked creatures will have all
 
> Combat Damage Step
 
This is the step where combat damage hits the creatures/players.
 
If a creature is blocked, it will deal its damage and take the damage of its attacker.
 
>ABILITIES OF NOTE:
 
Some abilities have a great impact on combat.
- First Strike
 
        A creature with this ability hits first, dealing damage before being dealt damage by non-first strike creatures.
 
        EX:
        Imagine a Master Swordsman fighting a Regular Swordsman. They are faster and can hit first. This is essentially first strike.
 
        If two creatures with first strike fight each other, their First strike abilities will basically cancel out.
 
- Double Strike
 
        This is First strike combined with regular strike.
 
        Creatures with this ability can attack a player, kill a weaker blocking creature AND deal damage with the second hit where a First strike or Regular strike creature would only defeat the weaker creature.
 
- Trample
 
        This ability means that "leftover" damage from a creature blocking a creature with Trample will move on to hit the player.
 
        EX:
        Imagine a bullet traveling towards a person wearing a kevlar vest.
        The bullet is the creature with trample, the vest is the blocking creature, and the person wearing the vest is the defending player.
 
        Any force not absorbed by the vest will travel into the person wearing it, causing harm. That's Trample.
 
- Vigilance
        A creature with Vigilance will not Tap when attacking.
 
        Fighting is hard work and makes most creatures so tired they cannot block when tapped.
 
        Creatures with Vigilance don't tap and can attack for combat then be assigned as a defender should their player be attacked next turn.
 
- Deathtouch
 
        Any damage dealt by a creature with deathtouch will kill another creature (unless they are invulnerable).
        Doesn't matter how strong a creature is, if the deathtouch damage hits em’ they're toast.(unless they are invulnerable)
 
> End of Combat Step
 
 Some cards have abilities that trigger here -> "At the end of combat, do this..."
 
 Some cards have abilities that stop being applied here -> " Until the End of Combat, do this..."
 
# Post-Combat Main Phase/ Main Phase 2:
 
This is another phase in which you can play any spell but some have special interactions when played after somethings happen (like damage to a player, a creature dying, etc) so their effects can be maximized by smart plays.
 
    For example, you have a weak 1/1 creature and your opponent has a 10/10. You attack with the 1/1 and your opponent blocks the damage, assigning lethal damage to the 1/1 and killing it. Then in the second main phase you play a spell called Tragic Slip...
 
        Tragic slip - B - Instant
 
        Target creature gets -1/-1 until the end of turn.
 
        Morbid — That creature gets -13/-13 until the end of turn instead if a creature died this turn.
 
    Because the 1/1 died, the Morbid ability is allowed to trigger, thus giving the 10/10 with one damage a -13/13 to its power and toughness. This will reduce the creature's toughness to below or equal to zero and kill the big scary creature all for just one weak 1/1 and one Black Mana.
 
# Ending Phase ( 2 parts ):
 
> End Step
 
It is usually the last opportunity for a player to perform any action before the next player's turn starts
 
> Cleanup Step
 
Spells and abilities may be played during this step only if the conditions for any state-based actions exist or if any abilities have triggered. In that case, those state-based actions are performed and/or those abilities go on the stack and the active player gets priority and players may cast spells and activate abilities. Once all players pass priority when the stack is empty, the step repeats.
 
Basically - This is the step where damage/defense stats of creatures reset all nice and tidy before the next player takes a turn.
 
    Damage Example:
        A 5/5 Bear attacks a Player who uses a 3/3 Elk to block. The Bear does not have trample and all of the damage goes to the Elk.
        Until the cleanup step at the end of the turn, The Bear will have 3 damage assigned to it meaning that if it takes 2 more damage, it will die.
        This isn't super prevalent but in decks (usually Red) that deal damage with spells, it can be used in conjunction with blocking strong creatures with weak creatures in order to trick the opponent into allowing their creature to take damage.
